Create a World Compensation Ecosystem based on Decentralised Financial Applications.

Layers: 
1. Distributed peer-2-peer (P2P) Network (Blockchain based)
1. Distributed File system
1. Nodes are Servers
1. Nodes run System- and Users-services
1. Users decide to participate or not (mounting/unmounting) as service suppliers in the network
1. Users interact with other users or service suppliers
1. Users transfer value-assets to single or multiple-users or services
1. Spontaneous Users connect and use the network only for short-time (SMS, PPP)
1. Value-assets are represented via Addresses in the Distributed File system
1. User or User-services interact via read/write file operations with other Users or User-services
1. User providing User-services are debted certain agreed amount per-use
1. System-services are debted per-use, daily, monthly or yearly on donation basis

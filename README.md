## Purpose

Simple. *Eliminate money invisibility*.

## User-story

I dare you to...
> Throw out all your money, all your papers and coins and individual national currencies, and start over.

> Develop an international monetary system that is wide open, totally visible, immediately traceable, completely accountable.
> 
> Establish a Worldwide Compensation System by which people would be given *Credits for services rendered and products produced*, and *Debits for services used and products consumed*.

> Under the new Worldwide Compensation System, WCS, *the transfer of Debits and Credits would be immediate and totally visible*.
> That is, anybody and everybody could inspect the account of any other person or organization at any time.
> *Nothing* would be kept secret, nothing would be 'private'

> Everything would be on the system of Credits and Debits.
> Returns on investments, inheritances, winnings of wagers, salaries and wages, tips and gratuities, everything.
> The WCS would deduct 10 percent of all earnings each year from the income of those *voluntarily requesting* such a deduction.
> Everyone in the society would be able to observe who was choosing to offer the 10 percent for the general good of all, and who was not.
> And *everyone's records would be open to everyone else*.
> And nothing could be purchased without Credits.
> There would be no other negotiable currency. ([source:#CWG, @realNDWalsch](http://nealedonaldwalsch.com))

## Purpose

Simple. Eliminate money invisibility.

## User-story

> I dare you to throw out all your money, all your papers and coins and individual national currencies, and start over.

> Develop an international monetary system that is wide open, totally visible, immediately traceable, completely accountable.
> Establish a Worldwide Compensation System by which people would be given Credits for services rendered and products produced, and Debits for services used and products consumed.

> Under the new Worldwide Compensation System, WCS, the transfer of Debits and Credits would be immediate and totally visible.
> That is, anybody and everybody could inspect the account of any other person or organization at any time.
> Nothing would be kept secret, nothing would be 'private'

> Everything would be on the system of Credits and Debits.
> Returns on investments, inheritances, winnings of wagers, salaries and wages, tips and gratuities, everything.
> The WCS would deduct 10 percent of all earnings each year from the income of those *voluntarily requesting* such a deduction.
> Everyone in the society would be able to observe who was choosing to offer the 10 percent for the general good of all, and who was not.
> And everyone's records would be open to everyone else.
> And nothing could be purchased without Credits.
> There would be no other negotiable currency. ([source:#CWG, @realNealWealsh](http://ISBN))

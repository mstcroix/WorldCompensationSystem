## Foreword 
_Genesis: CWG p. 186_¬†

Then God said, I dare you to:
> 1. Throw out all your money, all your papers and coins and individual national currencies, and start over. 
> 1. Develop an international monetary system that is wide open, totally visible, immediately traceable, completely accountable. 
> 1. Establish a Worldwide Compensation System by which people would be given Credits for services rendered and products produced, and Debits for services used and products consumed. 

And it was so.

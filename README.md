### Customer requirements
### Part I (2012-2019)

> Develop an international monetary system that is wide open, totally visible, immediately traceable, completely accountable. 

__Platform:__ #Blockchain

🙏🏽 Satoshi Nakamoto

### Part II (2019-2026)

> Establish a Worldwide Compensation System by which people would be given Credits for services rendered and products produced, and Debits for services used and products consumed.

__Whitepaper:__ [#WorldCompensationSystem](#worldcompensation), #WCS 

#### Objective
> Under the new Worldwide Compensation System, WCS, the transfer of Debits and Credits would be immediate and totally visible.
> That is, anybody and everybody could inspect the account of any other person or organization at any time.
> Nothing would be kept secret, nothing would be 'private'

> Everything would be on the system of Credits and Debits.
> Returns on investments, inheritances, winnings of wagers, salaries and wages, tips and gratuities, everything.

__Platform:__ #DeFi, #RSK, @rsksmart, @rif_os

🙏🏽 @dieguito, @GabrielKurman


### Part III (2026-2033)

> The WCS would deduct 10 percent of all earnings each year from the income of those *voluntarily requesting* such a deduction.
> Everyone in the society would be able to observe who was choosing to offer the 10 percent for the general good of all, and who was not.
> And everyone's records would be open to everyone else.

### Part IV (2033-2040)

> And nothing could be purchased without Credits.
> There would be no other negotiable currency.


"And God looked upon all that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning— the sixth day."

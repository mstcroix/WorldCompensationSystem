__Status__: *in work*

## Purpose

Simple. Eliminate money invisibility.

## User-story

> I dare you to throw out all your money, all your papers and coins and individual national currencies, and start over.

> Develop an international monetary system that is wide open, totally visible, immediately traceable, completely accountable.
> Establish a Worldwide Compensation System by which people would be given Credits for services rendered and products produced, and Debits for services used and products consumed.

> Under the new Worldwide Compensation System, WCS, the transfer of Debits and Credits would be immediate and totally visible.
> That is, anybody and everybody could inspect the account of any other person or organization at any time.
> Nothing would be kept secret, nothing would be 'private'

> Everything would be on the system of Credits and Debits.
> Returns on investments, inheritances, winnings of wagers, salaries and wages, tips and gratuities, everything.
> The WCS would deduct 10 percent of all earnings each year from the income of those *voluntarily requesting* such a deduction.
> Everyone in the society would be able to observe who was choosing to offer the 10 percent for the general good of all, and who was not.
> And everyone's records would be open to everyone else.
> And nothing could be purchased without Credits.
> There would be no other negotiable currency. ([source:#CWG, @realNealWealsh](http://ISBN))

## Architecture
/arch:

### Concept

Create a World Compensation Ecosystem based on Decentralised Financial Applications.

__Implementation__:

* Operation System (including fs, dfs, time-shared applications)

[wcsOS](http://wikipedia.com/wiki/wcsOS) -- linux based distribution

__Layers__:

1. Distributed peer-2-peer (P2P) Network (Blockchain based)
1. Distributed File system (dfsWcs)
1. Nodes are Servers
1. Servers
   1. run System- and Users-services
   1. route User- and System- interactions (transactions)
1. Users are Clients
1. Clients decide to participate or not (mounting/unmounting) as service suppliers in the network
1. Clients interact with other Clients
1. Clients request services from Servers (service suppliers)
   1. Via Remote Procedure Call (RPC) returning values in JSON format
1. Clients transfer value-assets to single or multiple-users or services
1. Light-Clients connect and use the network only for short-time (SMS, PPP)
1. Value-assets are represented via Addresses in the Distributed File system
1. Clients and Servers interact via read/write file operations with eachother
1. Servers providing User-services are debted certain agreed amount per-use
1. Servers providing System-services are debted an agreed amount per-use, daily, monthly or yearly on donation basis


### Network

__Topology__: Flower or Tree-of-Life (sacred geometry star 1:N, N:=6)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Modern_usage

__Nodes__:

```
Full-nodes:
 - store the complete history of command-blocks (analog to batch-files (a.k.a transactions))
Light-nodes:
 - store, validate and reconstruct environment from all nodes in local network (only) -- bis maximal 3x BrÃ¼cke (Gateway)
```

### Remote (distributed) File-system

TCP/IP Server
 :port
UNIX's "Everything is a File" -> (name:Address)

### Network Startup

```
$wcsStart &
World Compensation System server (wcss) running
Listening on port:280182

$wcsStatus
Status: OK
```

### Command, Services and Tools

- [bin](/bin) - Local commands, services and tools
- [dbin](/dbin) - Distributed (Remote) user-commands and user-tools

# Glossary

- [term](definition) - short explanation


## Definitions
__Assets__:

Work-product (document, software application, drawing (diagram), picture) that was created and can be:
- stored,
- used (executed, applied to), or
- exchanged (ownership transfer: lend/borrow, inheritance, etc.)

__Value__:

The intrinsic 'cost' of producing and using a given asset
- *universal* unit of credit: cost (node operation cost)
- present value: (development + production cost)
- future value: (service cost) -- reputation based

__Transaction (Asset (Credits or Debts)-value Transfer)__:
- Blockchain->Browser->Distributed File-System->Local File-System->Blockchain->Remote File-System

1. User->Client (Application)
1. Client->Browser
1. Browser (Peer)-to-(Peer)-Network (Blockchain)
1. ...

__Credits__:

credit - a given amount granted in exchange of local-resource-time (normally computing power or manual labour) consumption/usage
- run a service in a remote:node

__Debits__:

debit - crediting unit referring the used time during required computation
- debiting-time - time used during computation * fix cost (internet, electricity)
- visibility (production cost, service price), e.g. (2,34)

__Services__:

service - an action executed virtually (software) or physically (hardware)
- eg. (software:x386:server) hashvalueof bigfile.bin
- (hardware:raspberrypi:io) getoutsidetemp

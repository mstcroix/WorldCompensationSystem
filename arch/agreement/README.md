## Agreement rules

### Agreement

1. We (debited,credited) only need to agree between each-other (no third-parties are required)
1. I send (transfer) the ownership (value) to you.
1. Did you receive (accepted) it? 
    - a) Yes I received it and accepted it. Then I cannot use it anymore (is locked (own via public-key) now by you)
    - b) No I don’t. Wait for timeOut. Try again from 3)

Agreement by hashing each others compound
    usera hash(data) --> userb
    
Write state
Hash with other user’s public key (only receiver user can consume the state)
Repeat (Write state, Hash)

### Trust

Trust is build up organically.
Usually only on direct peer/to/peer basis (or reputation based)
You only need to “know” someone to get started or to create (“produce”) something of value to exchange in the network

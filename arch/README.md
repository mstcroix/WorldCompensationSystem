## Architecture

## Concept

Create a World Compensation Ecosystem based on Decentralised Financial Applications.

Implementation: Operation System (including fs, dfs, time-shared applications)

[wcsOS](wikipedia:wcsOS) -- linux based distribution

Layers:
1. Distributed peer-2-peer (P2P) Network (Blockchain based)
1. Distributed File system (dfsWcs)
1. Nodes are Servers
1. Servers
   1. run System- and Users-services
   1. route User- and System- interactions (transactions)
1. Users are Clients
1. Clients decide to participate or not (mounting/unmounting) as service suppliers in the network
1. Clients interact with other Clients
1. Clients request services from Servers (service suppliers)
   1. Via Remote Procedure Call (RPC) returning values in JSON format
1. Clients transfer value-assets to single or multiple-users or services
1. Light-Clients connect and use the network only for short-time (SMS, PPP)
1. Value-assets are represented via Addresses in the Distributed File system
1. Clients and Servers interact via read/write file operations with eachother
1. Servers providing User-services are debted certain agreed amount per-use
1. Servers providing System-services are debted an agreed amount per-use, daily, monthly or yearly on donation basis


### Network

__Topology__: Flower or Tree-of-Life (sacred geometry star 1:N, N:=6)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Modern_usage

__Nodes__:

```
Full-nodes: store the complete history of command-blocks (analog to batch-files (a.k.a transactions))
Light-nodes: store, validate and reconstruct environment from all nodes in local network (only) -- bis maximal 3x BrÃ¼cke (Gateway)
```
### Local File-system

```
RK1.0
/ - WCS root Ecosystem
/commands
/dbin/ - Decentralised System services
/users/ - connected user addresses {publickey:addresshash:alias:inbox} (analog to /mnt)

RK1.1
/apps
/lang - implementation language specific files
/tools - Utility tools

RK1.2
/dapp/ - Decentralised User or Third-Party Applications (executable -- analog to /usr/bin)

```

### Remote (distributed) File-system

[/arch/dfs](dfs)

```
RK2
/dapp/DeFi/ - Decentralised Financial Apps

```

### Realisation

TCP/IP Server
 :port
UNIX's "Everything is a File" -> (name:Address)
 - Network (distributed) File-System

#### Support Tools
```
neo4.js - Graph Database
```

### Common Use-cases

* transfer value-assets

### Network Startup

```
$wcsStart &
World Compensation System server (wcss) running
Listening on port:280182

$wcsStatus
Status: OK
```

### Command, Services and Tools
```
mount - loads/unloads foreign WCS Networks
ls - show current Users in the Ecosystem
mv - allocate users in different sub-network
whoami -
ps - process
ping - ping
telnet - establish connection and echo server
mailto - use mail-alies to transfer transfer value-assets in the network
```

### Application Notes
```
$whoami
{0x123456:mstcroix:mstcroix@protonmail.com}

$pwd
/

$ls
/apps
/commands
/dapps
/services
/users

$ls /users
/users/{0x123456:mstcroix:mstcroix@protonmail.com}
/users/{0x423456:mstcroix:none}
/users/{0x223456:anonymous:none}
/users/{0x723456:mstcroix:mstcroix@protonmail.com}

$ps
0 applications running

$/apps/App1 &
$ps
/apps/App1 running. 5 users connected
```

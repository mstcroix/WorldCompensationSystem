## Architecture

### Concept

Create a World Compensation Ecosystem based on Decentralised Financial Applications.

__Implementation__:

* Operation System (including fs, dfs, time-shared applications)

[wcsOS](http://wikipedia.com/wiki/wcsOS) -- linux based distribution

__Layers__:

1. Distributed peer-2-peer (P2P) Network (Blockchain based)
1. Distributed File system (dfsWcs)
1. Nodes are Servers
1. Servers
   1. run System- and Users-services
   1. route User- and System- interactions (transactions)
1. Users are Clients
1. Clients decide to participate or not (mounting/unmounting) as service suppliers in the network
1. Clients interact with other Clients
1. Clients request services from Servers (service suppliers)
   1. Via Remote Procedure Call (RPC) returning values in JSON format
1. Clients transfer value-assets to single or multiple-users or services
1. Light-Clients connect and use the network only for short-time (SMS, PPP)
1. Value-assets are represented via Addresses in the Distributed File system
1. Clients and Servers interact via read/write file operations with eachother
1. Servers providing User-services are debted certain agreed amount per-use
1. Servers providing System-services are debted an agreed amount per-use, daily, monthly or yearly on donation basis


### Network

__Topology__: Flower or Tree-of-Life (sacred geometry star 1:N, N:=6)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Modern_usage

__Nodes__:

```
Full-nodes:
 - store the complete history of command-blocks (analog to batch-files (a.k.a transactions))
Light-nodes:
 - store, validate and reconstruct environment from all nodes in local network (only) -- bis maximal 3x BrÃ¼cke (Gateway)


 (light-Node) User : reads, modifies and stores state in Blockchain
 - In browser (js Linux machine)
 - Web App
 - Mobile App

 full-Node (service provider server) : offers (shares) execution time
 - USB live CD
 - Floppy disk
```
### Local File-system

Refer to [/arch/fs](/arch/fs)

### Remote (distributed) File-system

Refer to [/arch/dfs](/arch/dfs)

### Realisation

TCP/IP Server
 :port
UNIX's "Everything is a File" -> (name:Address)
 - Network (distributed) File-System

#### Support Tools

- [neo4j]() - Graph Database
- [jslinux](https://bellard.org/jslinux/) - Web-Browwer Linux
- [128-bit OS](https://bellard.org/tinyemu/) - 128-bit RISC OS

Listening on port:280182

$wcsStatus
Status: OK
```

### Command, Services and Tools
